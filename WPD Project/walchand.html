Walchand College of Engineering is situated midway between Sangli and Miraj cities at Vishrambag, Sangli. The WCE campus is located on about 90 acres of land on southern side of Sangli – Miraj road. 

 In 1947, the college made a modest beginning as New Engineering College, with a single program leading to B.E. (Civil) degree. In the year 1955, the College was renamed as Walchand College of Engineering as part of the new arrangements and pursuant to the Rehabilitation and Development Program mainly funded by Seth Walchand Hirachand Memorial Trust and the Government. The Government appointed an Ad Hoc Committee for conducting the college from May 1955, later replaced by the Administrative Council in 1956. The Ad Hoc Committee added two more degree programs in B.E. (Mechanical) and B.E. (Electrical) in 1955 with the intake of 20 each. Three Diploma programs also started in 1955 – Civil (40 intake), Mechanical (20) and Electrical (20).

Post Graduate programs in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and Diploma program in Industrial Electronics were introduced in 1971. In 1986 the UG and PG programs in Electronics Engineering and UG program in Computer Science and Engineering were introduced. 

PG program in CSE was introduced in 1997. In 2001, added B.E. program in Information Technology with an intake of 60 students. An additional intake of 30 students was also sanctioned for Computer Science & Engineering program, resulting in total intake of 390 students for all branches at UG level and 106 at PG level. As part of strategic planning, PG section is being strengthened and PG intake has now steadily risen to 240 across 10 programs. The College has a QIP scheme for full-time doctoral programs and also offers Ph. D. programs of Shivaji University in various branches of engineering.

Walchand College of Engineering became autonomous in 2007. The college revamped its academic structure and contents, in consultation with few US and IIT academic experts. Accordingly nomenclature of B.E and M.E programs has been changed to B Tech and M Tech programs. After completion of the first term of six years, the College has now received extension of autonomous status for the second term of six years till 2019-20. It participated in the World Bank funded, Government of India scheme, namely, Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) in Phase I from 2005-2009, wherein it stood all-India 2nd out of 127 participating institutions in terms of program impact performance. The college is presently participating in Phase II of TEQIP with outstanding performance            
VISION

<h1>History<br></h1>

Walchand College of Engineering offered its first academic program, an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering(B.E.(Civil)) for up to 60 students in 1947. In 1955, an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering (B.E.(Elec)) was established, and a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree (B.E.(Mech)) was offered in 1956. Both programs had a 60 student capacity. Postgraduate coursework in all three engineering disciplines was first offered in 1971. Graduate and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Electronics Engineering were added in the 1980s and 1990s.

Postgraduate courses in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and a diploma course in Industrial Electronics were introduced in 1971. In 1986, undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Electronics Engineering and an undergraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering were introduced, and a postgraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering was introduced in 1997.

In 2001, the college added a Bachelor of Engineering course in Information Technology with a capacity of 60 students, and capacity for an additional 30 students was added to the Computer Science and Engineering course. Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Geology have been established.[when?]

The placement record of the college shows 464 Undergraduate students placed in organisations during 2010 and 2011.[4]

The college was selected under the World Bank funded Government of India scheme "Technical Education Quality Improvement Program"(TEQIP) in 2005. It received nearly Rs. 9 crores of funding under TEQIP which ended in March 2009. As reported in the survey conducted by Spectrum India, Walchand College ranked No. 2 all-India out of about 127 institutes that participated in TEQIP. In 2011, the college was selected under Phase II of TEQIP, focused on development of PG education.

<h1>Campus</h1>

The college campus spreads over an area of about 95 acres. The college has different buildings for different departments. The central quadrangle (as it is called) has classrooms large enough to seat 60-70 students, and a few classrooms with a capacity of around 100 students. At the center of the quadrangle is an Assembly Hall called Tilak Hall and an open-air theatre. The newly constructed library building also has a reading room.
<h1>Hostel</h1>

The college has had a hostel facility for males since 1958 and for females since 1987. There are eight hostel blocks (D1 to D8) with high speed internet connectivity through WiFi, and a capacity of 738 students. In response to the recent trend of increasing female enrollment, two hostel blocks were suitably modified and converted into women's hostels. At the initiative of the Chairman, Shri Ajit Gulabchand, another hostel block with a capacity of 46 students was converted into a cyber hostel with internet connectivity. Over 300 female students are presently inhabiting hostel accommodations. There is a plan to construct a new hostel for women, as per the new Campus Master Plan developed by the firm HOK (USA).
<h1>Lab Facilities</h1>
